# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-SAS-
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling project focused on customer churn in the telecommunications industry. The project was developed as part of the **Analytics for Business Decision Making** course at George Brown College.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using SAS. By analyzing customer data, service usage patterns, and billing information, we developed predictive models to identify customers at risk of churn. The project provides actionable insights and strategic recommendations to help telecom companies reduce churn and enhance customer retention.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Integration**: Merged multiple datasets (Customer Data, Internet Data, Churn Data) to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed logistic regression models to predict customer churn with an accuracy of 89.88%.
- **Strategic Insights**: Identified key factors influencing churn, such as contract type, payment method, and service usage patterns.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Provided targeted strategies to reduce churn, including personalized offers, improved customer service, and optimized payment methods.

## Data Sources
- **Customer Data**: Demographic information, contract details, and billing history.
- **Internet Data**: Service usage patterns, monthly charges, and additional services.
- **Churn Data**: Churn status, churn date, and reasons for churn.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and integrated data from multiple sources, handled missing values, and prepared the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted in-depth analysis to identify trends, patterns, and correlations with customer churn.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed and evaluated logistic regression models using SAS. Key metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).
- **Model Deployment**: Integrated the best-performing model into operational systems for real-time churn prediction.

## Findings
- **Demographic Insights**: Senior citizens and customers with short-term contracts are more likely to churn.
- **Service Usage**: Customers lacking essential services (e.g., online security, device protection) are at higher risk of churn.
- **Payment Methods**: Customers using electronic checks have a higher churn rate compared to those using credit cards.
- **Model Performance**: The logistic regression model achieved an AUC of 0.8442, indicating strong predictive power.

## Business Impact
This project provides telecom companies with a data-driven approach to reducing customer churn. By implementing the recommended strategies, companies can improve customer retention, enhance satisfaction, and secure a competitive edge in the market.
